## Overview

Project Euler (https://projecteuler.net/about) is a list of mathematical problems meant to be solved using programming skills and is used for programmers to practice solving problems.

I will slowly be going through the problems (only the first 100 would be shown for public display as per the rules) using python in order to get some practice.
